                        <p>Prior to the arrival of Europeans in 1521, the Philippines was already settled by Austronesian (Malayo Polynesian) peoples. The Philippines became a Spanish colony in the 16th century, and a territory of the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1896, rebellion led the Philippine Revolution that won independence from Spain. American occupation of the Philippines during the Spanish-American War led to the outbreak of the Philippine-American War. A Commonwealth government was established in 1935, which allowed self-governance. The country gained its independence from the United States on July 4, 1946 after World War II. Martial law was declared in 1972 which led to the insurgencies of the New People`s Army and the Moro National Liberation Front. Liberal parties then led People Power Revolution of 1986, which would bring the country back to democracy.</p>
                        <p>The Philippines is one of only two predominantly Roman Catholic countries in Asia-Pacific, the other being East Timor. Pre-Hispanic indigenous rituals still exist; and there are also followers of Islam. Spanish was an official language of the Philippines until 1973. Since then, the two official languages are Filipino, and English.</p>
                        <p>The name Philippines was derived from King Philip II in the late 16th century. The Spanish explorer Ruy Lopez de Villalobes used the name Las Islas Filipinas (the Philippine Island) in honor of the then- Crown Prince during his expedition in the Philippines, originally referring to the islands of Leyte and Samar. Despite the presence of other names, the name Filipinas was eventually adopted as the name of the entire archipelago.</p>

                            <p>However, over its history, poor mining practices, especially by smaller scale operators have resulted in concerns over health, safety, the environment and indigenous rights and subsequent considerable anti-mining sentiment in the country, which is widely viewed as a problematic mining jurisdiction. This has been exacerbated by populist policies, often damaging to the local economies, overlapping policies between central and local government. It is first important to consider landmark moments from the mid 1990’s to contextualise perceptions of the mining industry today.</p>

The creeks are mostly steep V-shaped valleys while the rivers Alluvial plains widen progressively as they progress downstream before flowing into the Magat river. The Runruno area is characterised by a reasonably rugged topography with an alluvial flood plain located to the north. The elevation of the area ranges from 1507 meters ASL at Mt. Palali, the highest peak in the district, down to 240 meters ASL, at the confluence of the Magat River with the Sulong River to the north of Runruno. The site is principally situated within Forest Lands, while the lowland areas consisting of the alluvial plains being classified as “Alienable &amp; Disposable” comprising titled lands.

                            <p>Runruno sits at the intersection of the borders of two district-scale calderas, major NW and NE fault lines and a number of small volume, late composite volcanic centres. Mineralization at Runruno is hosted by a shallow-dipping fault zone of potassically-altered sericitized and brecciated tuffs and andesites which have been variably pyritized and silicified. Gold mineralization is preferentially hosted within fractures, faults, and breccias.</p>
                            <p>The style of gold mineralisation in Runruno is mostly as fine disseminations associated with pyrite and/or molybdenite. The origin of the mineralisation is believed to be fault controlled. Gold mineralisation is hosted by low angle structures enveloped by bluish to gray colour altered wall rock containing fine-grained sulphides, molybdenite and tennantite. Gold occurs both as megascopic native particles and as microscopic inclusions in pyrite. The small nature of these intrusions results in the gold mineralisation at Runruno being refractory.</p>

In early 1970s a company called Fil-Am Resources completed a total of 8,670 metres of diamond drilling at the deposit over a strike length of 800 metres, also opening up three adits and developing around 800 metres of exploratory drives. Results of Fil-Am's channel sampling of the drives returned some bonanza grades of up to 367 g/t Au with the main area averaging 87 g/t Au over a 40 metre by 20 metre area.</h5>

                          <p>The activity in the project accelerated in the 1990s and in 1997 when Philippine Gold signed a letter of intent with Placer Dome to enter into a joint venture over the Runruno project, whereby Placer Dome would have a 60% interest in the project, finance the first $5 million of exploration expenditures and manage the joint venture. However, as the metallurgical testing discovered the refractory nature of the mineralisation, which in combination with low gold prices, resulted in the work in the project area being suspended.</p>
                          <p>Metals Exploration acquired&nbsp; the license in 2005, producing a maiden 390 koz JORC resource in 2007, completing a scoping study, which outlined the BIOX<sup>®</sup> technology to extract the gold from the deposit’s refractory ores. The study was based on a nine year open pit operation, which in full production would produce about 183 koz/y of gold, from a 3 Mtpa mine and processing operation. This was scaled down for the Bankable Feasibility Study, which projected average production of 96,00oz of gold per annum over a 10 year mine life from a 2 Mtpa mine.</p>
                          <p>Initial construction work commenced in 2012. The construction work was delayed significantly due to a court challenge against the validity of the mine in 2012/2013 and then by Typhoon Lando, which resulted in the Philippines Mines and Geosciences Bureau ordering the Company to suspend mine development and to present a rehabilitation plan for the damage caused by the Typhoon in and around the project area.</p>
                          <p>Runruno produced first gold in 2016, however the Company’s financial situation was impacted &nbsp;due to its inability to service its debt from delays with construction and commissioning. This was compounded by a number of operational issues over the next several years.</p>
                          <p>In early 2019 &nbsp;the appointment of the new management team, lead by Darren Bowden, started the operational turnaround, helped by a rising gold price environment and a number of successful changes which the team made. The changes implemented by new management delivered a maiden operational profit in 2019.</p>

                              <p>Runruno is a conventional drill and blast open pit mining operation. The space available for waste dumps in the mine is constrained by the short strike length of the orebody and steep terrain. Consequently, the waste material from the pit is currently placed in ex-pit dumps, with the pit being developed to accommodate in-pit dumping to progressively fill the mining void. The open pit area is 600 metres x 1,500 metres, with mining taking place in stages longitudinally along the ore body to provide an average strip ratio and consistent ore delivery to the plant.</p>

                          <p>The small grained, typically less than 10 micron, nature of the Runruno gold mineralization in the pyrite makes Runruno ore unsuitable for conventional CIL processing. The Runruno processing plant is designed to treat these difficult to recover gold ores using state of the art technologies.</p>
                          <p>The ROM ore from Runruno is crushed prior to milling in a single-stage SAG mill. Gravity recoverable gold from the mill discharge is recovered in a gravity circuit achieving approximately 25% gold recoveries. This is followed by the well-established bacterial leaching (BIOX<sup>®</sup>) technology, which utilises cultivated bacterial which converts the sulphide minerals and exposes the gold for subsequent cyanidation. The target sulphur grade required from flotation for the BIOX<sup>® </sup>process to run optimally is 17%.</p>
                          <p>After leaching in CIL, Runruno utilises the ASTER™ (Activated Sludge Tailings Effluent Remediation process), which is a biological cyanide destruction process that allows for a more efficient and more environmentally friendly water balance control at the mine. The discharge solution at the CIL is treated using a detox process to reduce the free cyanide concentration to below 50 ppm prior to ASTER™ which reduces the total cyanide and thiocyanate concentrations to below 1 ppm. The combined flotation tailings, neutralized effluent and detoxified CIL residue is pumped to the tailing dam. Process water is subsequently recovered from the RSI and recycled to the processing plant as required.</p>

                          <p>Runruno was besieged with technical problems from day one in both the mining and processing aspects of the operation. Feed grade significantly ended up being significantly lower than that projected in the feasibility study together with poor flotation performance, the BIOX<sup>®</sup> circuit was operated in the range of 40-50% of the sulfur design capacity. The management team led by Darren Bowden fixed the many technical issues at the operation to turn it into a profitable, steady state operation, as outlined below:</p>

                              <p>Three core issues with the plant were identified and corrected under the new management:</p>
                              <ol>
                                <li><strong>Maintenance: </strong>A lack of maintenance hamstrung Runruno significantly until the new management initiated a turn around. Maintenance reliability is critical to maintain steady state operations of a processing plant which is a requirement for the performance of the BIOX<sup>®</sup> system. Whilst chemical processes have the ability to recover quickly from short term failure and reliability issues, BIOX<sup>®</sup> does not. The new management started to undertake maintenance and upgrades of key operating and back up circuits in 2019.</li>
                                <li><strong>Flotation: </strong>Whilst BIOX<sup>®</sup> is widely viewed as a highly complex, sensitive technology, the primary problems at the Runruno processing plant had to do with the inefficient operation of the flotation circuit. Flotation was never recognized as a bottleneck prior until the end of 2018, once the new management came in. Significant amount of gold was not getting into the flotation circuit, with only 40 tpd of Sulphur concentrate produced versus 70 tpd design capacity. This was corrected following extensive lab testing, with pH corrected to a range between pH8 and pH9, at which flotation started to operate at design parameters.&nbsp;With increase in mill throughput and increase in proportion of sulphide ore in the mill feed since, sulphide feed to BIOX<sup>®</sup> reached and exceeded the design tonnes.</li>
                                <li><strong>BIOX<sup>®</sup> circuit: </strong>Once issues with the flotation circuit were fixed in 2019 and enhanced in 2020 and flotation concentrate feed exceeded design capacity, BIOX<sup>®</sup> performance deteriorated and became evident as the major process bottleneck. The result of the underperforming BIOX<sup>®</sup> circuit was a reduction in the CIL recovery despite optimization and improvement in the CIL operation since April 2019. Corrections to these failures resulted in an increase of concentrate oxidation from 60% to 80%. CIL gold recovery depends strongly on sulphide oxidation in the BIOX<sup>®</sup> process.</li>
                              </ol>
                              <p>These efforts resulted in the overall recovery increase at the Runruno mill to 82% up from 50-60% prior to 2019. This has resulted in a huge decrease in per ounce cash costs despite the overall increase in overall yearly processing costs of around 14% (up from $24m to $28m). The efforts to improve the efficiency of the mill are continuing and the management is targeting recoveries of 85-86% by the end of 2021 with further design changes to BIOX<sup>®</sup>.</p>

                          <p>A number of improvements were made with respect to operating the Runruno open pit, which ensured the pit can operate smoothly until the end of mine life. The Runruno pit runs through Malilibeg Fault, however prior to 2019, there were no considerations for the fault in the mine design, which resulted in a number of unexpected pit failures starting in 2018, which effected the mining rates at Runruno. The new management redesigned the pit to put in a cutback, to satisfy the required factor of safety for the pit walls. This increased waste movements and stripping ratios from the original designs, however this will ensure safe and stable operation of the pit till 2026.</p>
                          <p>In addition, the original mine design had major issues with the design of the mine access. As previously mentioned all the mined waste gets placed back in the Runruno pit and thus pit design is staged, where material from a following stage is place back into the pit viod created from the previous stages. &nbsp;Previous design didn’t properly plan access ramps from one stage to another and without the redesign and proper sequencing the mine would have ended up being waste bound in 2021 and thus the production would get shut down. This has now been corrected with the redesign of the mine wide ramp system and the mine will become very efficient by Q4 2021 with the waste mined to be backfilled in the stage 1 pit void, thus decreasing the amount of trucks required in the pit, lowering the overall cost base.</p>
                          <p>Finally, there was a distinct lack of definition drilling and thus the understanding of the mine reserves going forward. This is being corrected with significant money spent on reserve drilling. This will increase the confidence in the mine reserves in the stages 2 &amp; 3, with further work required in stages 4 &amp; 5, thus allowing for better forecasting and short and medium term mine planning.</p>
